<h1> <center> Air Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning & Sending A Alert Message </center> </h1>

## About 
Air pollution has emerged as a significant global health concern, with detrimental effects on human health and the environment. 
To address this issue, an Air Quality Alert System (AQAS) is proposed. The AQAS leverages advanced IoT technology and real-time data analytics to monitor and analyse air quality parameters in a specific region.
By continuously gathering data from a network of strategically placed sensors, the system provides accurate and timely information on pollutant levels, enabling timely alerts and proactive measures.

## Features

##### Air Quality Features:
Utilize critical attributes like PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, ozone levels, temperature, and humidity to predict air quality status using a machine learning model.

##### ML Model Development:
Apply algorithms like Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, or Support Vector Machines to classify air quality into categories (e.g., Good, Moderate, Hazardous) based on AQI standards.

##### Real-Time Alerts:
Integrate a notification system (e.g., SMS, email, or app-based alerts) using APIs like Twilio or Firebase to inform users when air quality crosses unsafe thresholds.

## Requirements
### Hardware Requirements:
##### Processor	: Pentium Dual Core 2.00GH
##### Hard disk	: 120 GB
##### RAM 		: 2GB (minimum)
##### Keyboard	: 110 keys enhanced
